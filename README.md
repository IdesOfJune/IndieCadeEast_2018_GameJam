# IndieCadeEast 2018 GameJam
A repository for games and artistic experiments created during a 12 hour game jam at IndieCade East. Games are in response to prompts from Jason Rohrer's body of work as exhibited in The Game Worlds of Jason Rohrer.

The repository is structured by game prompt, please follow the simple guidelines to add your game to the repository.
1. Fork this repository
2. Add a folder to the Repository titled (IN ALL CAPS) simply with the name of the prompt (i.e. TRANSCEND/)
3. Inside of your folder, place a README.md, and a single folder including your Blinks Sketch (.ino)
4. Your README.md can be as simple as the folling
```

5. Once you have committed your updates to your fork, create a Pull Request to merge your contributions in to this repository. I will review and accept your submission to be part of this collection of Blinks games.

Note: Don't worry about code cleanliness, having something present is better than nothing here, and the beautiful thing about version control is that it can improve over time, from multiple sources :)

with Blink'n love,
Jonathan Bobrow, Move38
