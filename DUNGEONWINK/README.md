"Dungeon Wink"

by Christian Plummer

Synopsis: This Munchkin-inspired dungeon crawler challenges you to find all of the gold while defeating enemies that might arrise along the journey. Find weapons, keep the most powerful of them, and discard the weak. Enemies might require many hits to defeat, be sure to keep your weapons on hand, otherwise you might have to give up your gold.

How to Play:

Key:
- RED = Enemy
- Green = Weapon (Tap to activate)
- Yellow = Gold

(each Blink shows a value for Enemy, Weapon, or Gold based on the count 1-6)

Add Blinks 1 at a time, sacrifice weak Blinks to dive deeper! Gather a pile of gold to win!

Pink + Cyan + Orange = You win

TIPS:

Need to start over? Just separate the Blinks.
